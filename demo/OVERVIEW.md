## 🚀 Summary

SaveQuest is a gamified savings app designed to make money management fun, social, and rewarding for students and young people. Instead of treating saving like a chore, SaveQuest transforms it into an adventure game, complete with progress bars, levels, badges, and challenges. 

Users set savings goals, track their progress visually, and unlock achievements as they reach milestones. The app also offers friendly competition and collaborative challenges, plus bite-sized financial literacy lessons as optional **“side quests.”**


## ✨ Key Features

 - **Gamified Savings Goal** - Create goals (e.g Save R50 this week) and fill progress bars as you save  
 - **Progress Tracking** - Visual dashboards that celebrate small wins and long-term progress.  
 - **Badges & Achievements** - Unlock rewards for streaks, milestones, and consistent saving habits  
 - **Friend Challenges** - Race to hit targets, joing group quests, or climb weekly leaderboards (among your friends)
 - **Financial Literacy Side Quests** - Short lessons and quizzes on money basics, with special badges for completing them


## 💡 Inspiration

Many young people struggle with managing their own money and often end up spending without realizing where it went.
SaveQuest makes saving fun and rewarding by turning it into a gamified experience.

We took inspiration from **Duolingo**, using playful gamification and addictive streaks to help users build consistent saving habits.
